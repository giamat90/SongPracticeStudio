### Added
- Lyrics panel with karaoke view and click-to-seek: CTC forced alignment of lyrics to the vocals stem.
- Automated test suites (vitest, cargo, pytest) run in CI on every push and pull request.

### Fixed
- The time readout and lyrics now follow a waveform click while playback is paused.
- The practice room no longer shows a spurious "No audio loaded" label when a song load was superseded by a newer one.
